My name is Jiaxuan Tang and currently working at Huawei doing simulation algorithms related work. I completed my undergraduate and graduate course in July 2022 at Imperial College London. <br> My interest lies on computer-aided engineering, simulations incluing finite element and computational fluid dynamics, and computer graphics especially physics simulation and computational geometry. I am always interested in using computer language describing numerous physics in the real world. <br> If you are interested in industrial software, CAE or physics simulations, do not hesitate to contact me! At the same time, it is welcome that you can chat about anime, cycling and anythings...
